RDF - > the concept
turtle -> is like the proglanguage for that model

Backend -> stroing & managing rdf data(json-ld, turtle) and providing API (rest or spaqrl endpoints)

Frontend -> deisplaying the rdf, calling the backend trhourgh http

Since i am using angular i firstly create a .ttl file and then convert it into json-ld

RDF is a graph, not a file. Entities are just nodes.

A namespace in RDF is essentially a shortcut for a long IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier).

IRIs are URLs that uniquely identify classes, properties, or entities.

Step 1 — ResearchProduct

Why first: It’s the central entity in OpenAIRE; all other entities relate to it in some way (authors, projects, organizations, communities, data sources).

You can start with just a few fields: id, mainTitle, type, publicationDate, publisher.

Links: You can gradually add links to authors, projects, organizations, etc.

Step 2 — Person (Authors/Contributors)

ResearchProducts have authors and contributors.

Creating Person nodes early makes linking to ResearchProducts easier.

Step 3 — Project

ResearchProducts are often linked to Projects (fundedBy).

Projects also link to Organizations and Persons.

Step 4 — Organization

Needed for author affiliations, project funders, or contributors.

You can start with just id and name for simplicity.

Step 5 — Community

Only needed if your ResearchProducts belong to communities.

Can be linked later once ResearchProducts, Persons, and Organizations exist.

Step 6 — DataSource

Only needed if you want to model where the ResearchProduct metadata was collected from.

Can be simple: id, name.
