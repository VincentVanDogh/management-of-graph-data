Prefix is like a nickname for a URL.

Defined at the top of the Turtle file with @prefix.

Used before a local name (like ResearchProduct or type) to create a full IRI.

Multiple prefixes can exist in a file to combine vocabularies:

@prefix rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
@prefix ex: <https://example.org/my-openaire/> .
@prefix op: <http://lod.openaire.eu/vocab/> .
