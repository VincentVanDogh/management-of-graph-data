    exs:description """<p>Open Research Gateway on Virtual Human Twins (sometimes referred as Digital Twins in Health).</p>

<p>Virtual Human Twin (VHT) is an integrated multiscale, multi-time, and multi-discipline representation of quantitative human physiology and pathology. Its realisation through a collaborative distributed knowledge and resource platform is specifically designed to accelerate the development, integration, and adoption of patient-specific predictive computer models, which will be used as clinical decision support systems, for personal health forecasting or as methodologies for the development and de-risking of personalised medical products. The vision of <a href="https://www.edith-csa.eu/">EDITH</a> is to facilitate the realisation of the opportunities presented by VHTs for the benefit of patients, healthcare providers, regulatory bodies and industry, both within Europe and globally.</p>

<div class="description">
<h3 class="title">ECOSYSTEM</h3>

<p>EDITH has the objective to frame an inclusive <strong>ecosystem</strong> of digital twins in healthcare within the EU Member States and associated countries. It will start with a comprehensive mapping of the existing relevant actors, initiatives, resources (i.e., models, data sets, methods, good practices, infrastructures, solutions, services), and barriers in the digital twins. This will ensure adequate clinical representation, while fostering collaboration and integration of all relevant stakeholders, such as solution developers, technology providers, infrastructure providers, end-users (healthcare professionals and patients), regulatory agencies, and Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="box">
<div class="icon roadmap">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="description">
<h3 class="title">ROADMAP</h3>

<p>EDITH has the objective to build a <strong>roadmap</strong> with all the necessary conditions to evolve towards an integrated Virtual Human Twin (VHT). The roadmap will identify the necessary building blocks to ensure the VHT&rsquo;s clinical application and formulate clear short- and mid-term policy recommendations. It will also address aspects of interoperability, computability, health information integration from various sources. It will identify any possible implementation needs and barriers, including the development of a strategic approach for clinical deployment of the VHT model. This will foster the uptake of personalised clinical decision-making, with a particular focus on areas of unmet medical needs.</p>

<h3 class="title">REPOSITORY</h3>

<p>EDITH has the objective to develop a federated and cloud-based <strong>repository</strong> of digital twins (data, models, algorithms, and good practices) in healthcare. The repository will provide a virtual collaboration environment for multiple users and organisations, that will pool together existing digital twin resources across Europe. The ecosystem will be leveraged to create a repository catalogue with available resources and recruit resources into the repository from the consortium and external contributors. Through a federated approach, links will be established with ongoing initiatives that have complementary objectives.</p>

<p>EDITH has the objective to develop the architecture of a <strong>simulation platform</strong> that will support the transition towards an integrated Virtual Human Twin (VHT). EDITH&rsquo;s platform, based on a personal user account with specific permissions, will outline how to provide users with a one-stop shop to design, develop, test, and validate single organ digital twins, and combine them with other twins to build integrated VHT models. Five use-cases (cancer, cardiovascular, intensive care, osteoporosis, brain) have been pre-selected to be developed as prototypes, representing the variety of functionalities to be provided by the platform.</p>

    exs:description "<p>The European University for Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability - EU-CONEXUS promotes common European values and a strengthened European identity by bringing together a new generation of Europeans, who can cooperate and work within different European cultures, in different languages and across borders, sectors and academic disciplines. EU-CONEXUS is committed to creating a new institutional framework for higher education in Europe that allows for a truly European way of studying and carrying out research through institutional alignment and seamless mobility for all.&nbsp;</p> <p>The thematic framework Smart Urban Coastal Sustainability (SmUCS) means for EU-CONEXUS to focus its research &amp; innovation, education and knowledge sharing activities on societal challenges that are linked to a specific geographical location &ndash; the urban and semi-urbanised coastal (rivers and oceans) regions. SmUCS is not a subject-driven thematic framework, but a challenge-driven education and research domain.</p>" ;
