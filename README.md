# README

This project consists of two sections - backend and frontend
* Backend: Graph data logic
  * RDF
  * Property graphs

* Frontend: Displaying graph data

## How to run

So far, backend does not provide any REST functionality. To run frontend, simply open the frontend directory, or cd into
the directory, and run the standard Angular commands, meaning:
* ``npm install`` for package installation (need to do this just once)
* ``ng serve`` for running the application
